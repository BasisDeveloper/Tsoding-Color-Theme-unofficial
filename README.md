[- Tsoding's Youtube channel -](https://www.youtube.com/c/TsodingDaily)

This is a theme based on the Tsoding Daily Youtube channel's frequently used code editor theme (the older one). Just letting you know, if anything glows bright red in your face, it's because I didn't know what color that certain UI properties were affecting, and I wanted it to be obvious so I can fix it later.

They *wanted* me to also link a [repo](https://github.com/BasisDeveloper/Tsoding-Color-Theme-unofficial), so, sure.  *honestly I posted this just to sync it between computers...*

**Enjoy!**
