Hello everyone, and welcome to yet another VSCode theme.  

This theme is based on one of Tsoding's earliest color themes before it turned to the "*dark side*" <sup>*(higher contrast and darker)*</sup>, its seen [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yt7oWciNfM&t=1s&ab_channel=TsodingDaily)!   
But a darker and custom light theme are also supplied as well.

If you're looking for Tsoding's current theme for VSCode take a look at [JoaoAJMAto's Tsoding Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JoaoAJMAtos.tsoding-theme), it's great!
