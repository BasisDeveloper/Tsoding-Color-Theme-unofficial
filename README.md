#### [Tsoding Daily's Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/TsodingDaily)

This is a theme based on the Tsoding Daily Youtube channel's frequently used code editor theme, the older one. 
*I posted this primarily to sync it between my computers.*

They *wanted* me to also link a [repo](https://github.com/BasisDeveloper/Tsoding-Color-Theme-unofficial), so, sure.  

<sup> *If anything glows bright red in your face, it's because I didn't know what color that certain UI properties were affecting, and I wanted it to be obvious so I can fix it later.* </sup>

**Enjoy!**
